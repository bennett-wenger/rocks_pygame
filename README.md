# rocks_pygame
a fun little game made in Python

'rocks'
programmed by Bennett Wenger
2016

a modification of 'astrocrash'

Originally a homework project in my Python programming class,
I've decided to clean this up a little.
I'm uploading this as an example of what I can do in Python.

2023 update
I'd like to get this released as a usable game, using the latest Python and SuperWires.
My original PNG and audio files have been lost, and the Pygame website is down.
So I've got some work to do.
