# rocks_pygame
a fun little game made in Python

'rocks'
programmed by Bennett Wenger
2016

a modification of 'astrocrash'

Originally a homework project in my Python programming class,
I've decided to clean this up a little.
I'm uploading this as an example of what I can do in Python.

Sound and visuals based on resources provided in-class,
with a few exceptions.
Heavily modified by me.
Available upon request.

This program has been tested under the following conditions:
Windows 10
Python 3.1.4
Pygame 1.9.1
Livewires 2.0
